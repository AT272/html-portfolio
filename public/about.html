<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am 23 yaers old and I am from Iasi. I currently live in Bacau and I am a professional football player. I am married to Antonela, the love of my life, and we are expecting twins.</p>

<p>I am very happy with my life and I like improving every day. Back in highschool I enjoyed wrighting C++ code and I think I can be a part time web developer. This could be a nice hobby that can also pay some money.</p>

<p>I am now taking my first web developer course on Udemy and I just made my first webpage.</p>
